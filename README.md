# Depot `build-push-action` GitHub Action

This action implements the same inputs and outputs as the [`docker/build-push-action`](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action), but uses the [`depot` CLI](https://github.com/depot/cli) to execute the build.

## Setup

The `depot` CLI will need to be available in your workflow, you can use the [`depot/setup-action`](https://github.com/depot/setup-action) to install it:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: depot/setup-action@v1
```

## Usage

This action implements the same inputs and outputs as the [`docker/build-push-action`](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action). You will need to supply your project ID and Depot authentication information, although both can be inferred from the environment. See below for more details.

### Authentication

This action needs a Depot API token to communicate with your project's builders. You can supply this one of three ways. The third, using OICD, is the preferred method, but you can also supply a token directly.

1. You can supply a user or project API token via the `token` input:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
       with:
         token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
   ```

2. You can supply a user or project API token via the `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
       env:
         DEPOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
   ```

3. Depot supports GitHub's [OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) tokens via a trust relationship, so your Actions builds can securely authenticate with your Depot projects without any static access tokens. To configure the trust relationship, visit your Depot project settings, then add your repository and desired workflow config to `Trust Relationships`. Then in your workflow, enable the `id-token: write` permission:

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     # allow issuing OIDC tokens for this workflow run
     id-token: write
     # allow at least reading the repo contents, add other permissions if necessary
     contents: read
   steps:
     # no need to provide a DEPOT_TOKEN
     - uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
   ```

### Differences from `docker/build-push-action`

1. Authentication â€” this action needs to authenticate with a Depot API token to communicate with your project's builders (see above).

2. If you have not configured a `depot.json` file with `depot init`, you can explicitly specify your project ID via the `project` input:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
       with:
         project: abc123xyz
   ```

3. The `builder` input is not supported - this action always runs builds using Depot's hosted builders, if you need to route builds to a local buildx builder, you should use the `docker/build-push-action`.
4. Depending on how you are using `cache-from` / `cache-to`, you may be able to remove those options. Depot's builders launch with persistent local SSD cache, so unless you wish to push your cache to a registry for other reasons, you can remove them:

   ```diff
   steps:
     -
   -  uses: docker/build-push-action@v1
   +  uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
      with:
   -    cache-from: type=gha
   -    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
   ```

## Examples

Below are examples of how to use `depot/build-push-action` to build your Docker images using Depot builders. For all examples, it is assumed that you are either specifying the Depot project ID via the `project` or input, environment variable, or using a `depot.json` file.

### Basic build and push with OIDC token exchange

See our [trust relationship documentation](https://depot.dev/docs/cli/authentication#oidc-trust-relationships) for details on configuring this exchange.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id

### Basic build and push with Depot API tokens

You can use either Depot [project tokens](https://depot.dev/docs/cli/authentication#project-tokens) or [user tokens](https://depot.dev/docs/cli/authentication#user-access-tokens) in the `token` input.

**Note:** Project tokens are the recommendation if OIDC tokens are not an option.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest
          build-args: |
            FOO=bar
```

### Build multi-platform images

Depot supports building truly native multi-platform images, no emulation needed.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest
```
